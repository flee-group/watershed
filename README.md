# watershed 
An R package for watershed analysis.

This package provides a set of tools for analysing spatial watershed data. Spatial data (e.g., a delineated watershed raster from GRASS GIS or ArcGIS) can be imported, which is then used to generate an S4 object of the class Watershed.

A companion package, wsGrass, is available for managing the workflow for watershed delineation using an R frontend.
